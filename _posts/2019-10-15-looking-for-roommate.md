I'm looking for a responsible roommate to fill a spacious bedroom in my lovely 2 bedroom Williamsburg apartment. The apartment is on the top floor of a 3-storey building on [the corner of Humboldt St and Withers St](https://goo.gl/maps/wsAyYjSGAwtBURZu5). The rent is <b>$1,200/mo</b>, month to month, plus utilities (seasonal, ~$50/mo, heat + hot water included).

#### The Space

The room is approximately 11' by 12', with a large walk-in closet with built-in shelving. The room also has some pre-hung shelves and has two steam heaters.

The apartment itself gets toasty in the winter. The shower is quick to warm, and has good water pressure. The kitchen area has plenty of pots, pans, and plates and is kept clean. The living room has a TV, as well as a full DJ set up if you're so inclined.

##### Transportation

- **Graham Ave L**: 5 minutes
- **Nassau Ave G**: 15 minutes

Getting to Union Square from here can take as little as 12 minutes if the stars align, 20 on average. There are also ample Citibike stations, bus stops, and Revel scooters if you need alternate travel options.

#### The Neighborhood

This part of Williamsburg has a variety of quality shops and restaurants. There are at least three Italian specialty shops within a five minute walk, a wonderful coffee shop (Variety) on the way to the train, a pair of great local bars that can make late-night food (Mother's, Carmine's), multiple delis, and super tasty restaurants (Mesa Coyoacan, Ringolevio, Leila Alimentari). If you prefer to cook we have Meat Hook for fresh meats, a smattering of local produce shops, and are a ten minute walk to a weekly farmers market in McGolrick park.

This apartment is close to everything without feeling like you're in the middle of everything. Close to chill bars, local clubs, and plenty of parks.

#### About Me

I'm a software developer and amateur artist. I spend most of my time either at work or out in the neighborhood. I try to keep a clean and peaceful apartment and expect the same from others.
